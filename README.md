# Stop-motion Embroidery Design Parser

> A Python script to turn any DST file into a stop-motion enabled design 

The purpose of this script is to take a DST file provided from an embroidery design file and parse it into *pyembroidery* to add machine stops and trims. Adding these commands into the DST file allows a machine operator to load the machine and stitch the number of stitches automatically and then the machine will eject the design to take a picture; in much the same way as stop-motion.

PySimpleGUI is being used to make the script **easier to use** for **non-techie people**. The purpose of this script *could* be done solely in the command line, but why not have a GUI?
